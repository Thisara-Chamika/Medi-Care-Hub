            <h3>1. Diabetes</h3>
            <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Diabetes is often caused by a combination of genetic factors and lifestyle choices. If a person has a family history of diabetes, 
                they are more likely to develop it. Poor dietary habits—especially high sugar and processed food intake—and a lack of physical activity can increase the risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Common symptoms of diabetes include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased thirst (polydipsia)</li>
                    <li>Frequent urination (polyuria)</li>
                    <li>Fatigue or tiredness even after rest</li>
                </ul>
            These symptoms occur due to elevated blood sugar levels, which affect the body’s ability to use glucose for energy properly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> To reduce the risk of developing diabetes, individuals should:
                <ul>
                    <li>Eat a <b>balanced, healthy diet</b> rich in vegetables, whole grains, and low in sugar</li>
                    <li>Engage in <b>regular physical activity </b>(e.g., walking, cycling, or gym workouts)</li>
                    <li>Maintain a <b>healthy body weight</b>through consistent habits</li>
                </ul>
           
            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong>Diabetes can be managed effectively through:
                <ul>
                    <li> Medication such as Metformin (for Type 2)</li>
                    <li>Insulin therapy (essential for Type 1)</li>
                    <li>Making lifestyle changes like meal planning, exercise, and blood sugar monitoring</li>
                </ul>
            Early diagnosis and proper management can help prevent complications and lead to a healthy life.</p>
