                <div class="disease-text">
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Diabetes is often caused by a combination of genetic factors and lifestyle choices. If a person has a family history of diabetes, 
                    they are more likely to develop it. Poor dietary habits—especially high sugar and processed food intake—and a lack of physical activity can increase the risk.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Common symptoms of diabetes include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased thirst (polydipsia)</li>
                        <li>Frequent urination (polyuria)</li>
                        <li>Fatigue or tiredness even after rest</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These symptoms occur due to elevated blood sugar levels, which affect the body’s ability to use glucose for energy properly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> To reduce the risk of developing diabetes, individuals should:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eat a <b>balanced, healthy diet</b> rich in vegetables, whole grains, and low in sugar</li>
                        <li>Engage in <b>regular physical activity</b> (e.g., walking, cycling, or gym workouts)</li>
                        <li>Maintain a <b>healthy body weight</b> through consistent habits</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Diabetes can be managed effectively through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medication such as Metformin (for Type 2)</li>
                        <li>Insulin therapy (essential for Type 1)</li>
                        <li>Making lifestyle changes like meal planning, exercise, and blood sugar monitoring</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Early diagnosis and proper management can help prevent complications and lead to a healthy life.</p>

            <h3>2. Dengue</h3>
            <div class="disease-container">
                <img src="images/dengue.jpg" alt="Diabetes" class="disease-image">
                
                <div class="disease-text">
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Dengue is caused by the Dengue virus (DENV), 
                        which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. 
                        These mosquitoes usually bite during the daytime, especially early morning and before sunset. 
                        The virus has four strains (DENV-1 to DENV-4), and infection with one type doesn’t give long-term immunity to the others,
                        which increases the risk of severe dengue if re-infected.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms usually appear 4–10 days after the mosquito bite and include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>High fever (up to 104°F or 40°C)</li>
                            <li>Severe headaches and pain behind the eyes</li>
                            <li>Muscle and joint pain (sometimes called "breakbone fever")</li>
                            <li>Skin rash appearing a few days after fever onset</li>
                            <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
                            <li>Bleeding symptoms (such as nosebleeds, gum bleeding, or easy bruising), especially in severe cases</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Since there’s no specific antiviral cure for dengue, prevention is key:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by removing stagnant water in containers</li>
                            <li>Use mosquito repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus</li>
                            <li>Wear long-sleeved clothing and use mosquito nets or screens</li>
                            <li>Encourage community clean-up campaigns to reduce mosquito habitats</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                
                    <p><strong>Treatment:</strong>There is no specific antiviral treatment for dengue. Care is supportive:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rest and hydration are crucial to recovery</li>
                            <li>Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen can help with fever and pain</li>
                            <li><b>Avoid aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</b> (NSAIDs) as they can increase bleeding risk</li>
                        </ul>

            <div class="disease-container">
                <img src="images/cov.jpg" alt="Diabetes" class="disease-image">
                
                <div class="disease-text">
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> COVID-19 is caused by the <b>SARS-CoV-2</b> virus, which spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. It can also spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face (especially eyes, nose, or mouth). 
                        The virus emerged in late 2019 and led to a global pandemic.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms vary widely from mild to severe and usually appear 2–14 days after exposure. Common symptoms include:
                        <ul>
                        <li>Fever or chills</li>
                        <li>Dry cough</li>
                        <li>Loss of taste or smell</li>
                        <li>Fatigue and body aches</li>
                        <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
                        <li>Headache, sore throat, or congestion</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    Some individuals remain asymptomatic but can still spread the virus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Preventing COVID-19 involves both personal and public health measures:
                        <ul>
                        <li>Vaccination: Getting vaccinated significantly reduces the risk of severe illness.</li>
                        <li>Hand Hygiene: Wash hands frequently with soap for at least 20 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Face Masks: Wear masks in crowded or indoor public places.</li>
                        <li>Social Distancing: Maintain at least 1 meter distance from others.</li>
                        <li>Avoid Touching Face: Especially with unwashed hands.</li>
                        <li>Ventilation: Ensure good airflow in indoor spaces.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> There is no specific cure, but several treatments help manage the disease:
                        <ul>
                        <li>Supportive care: Includes rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications for symptoms like fever and pain.</li>
                        <li>Monoclonal antibodies: Can reduce the severity of illness in high-risk patients.</li>
                        <li>Antiviral medications: Remdesivir has been used in hospitalized patients.</li>
                        <li>Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone can help reduce inflammation in severe cases.</li>
                        <li>Hospitalization: Severe cases may require oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                <img src="images/influ.png" alt="Diabetes" class="disease-image">
                
                <div class="disease-text">
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Influenza is caused by influenza viruses, primarily types A and B, which are responsible for seasonal flu outbreaks. 
                        Type C causes milder respiratory symptoms and is less common. These viruses spread through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. 
                        The flu is highly contagious, especially in crowded places, schools, and public transport.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Common symptoms appear suddenly and may include:
                        <ul>
                        <li>High fever or chills</li>
                        <li>Dry cough</li>
                        <li>Sore throat</li>
                        <li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
                        <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
                        <li>Headache</li>
                        <li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li>
                        <li>Sometimes vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    These symptoms usually last for 3 to 7 days, but fatigue can persist for weeks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> To reduce the risk of getting or spreading influenza:
                        <li>Get an annual flu vaccine (the most effective method).</li>
                        <li>Wash hands frequently with soap and water.</li>
                        <li>Avoid close contact with sick individuals.</li>
                        <li>Use tissues or elbows to cover coughs and sneezes.</li>
                    Disinfect commonly touched surfaces (phones, door handles, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Treatment:</strong>     Antiviral medications (like oseltamivir/Tamiflu) may reduce severity and duration if taken early.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rest: Allow the body to recover.</li>
                            <li>Hydration: Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.</li>
                            <li>Fever reducers: Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage fever and pain (avoid aspirin in children).</li>
                        </ul>
                    Most people recover without complications, but it can be serious for infants, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.</p>

                    <p>
                        Heart disease is often caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries (atherosclerosis), which restricts blood flow. 
                        Major contributing factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.
                    </p>
                
                    <strong>Symptoms:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Common symptoms of heart disease include chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fatigue, irregular heartbeat, and swelling in the legs or feet. 
                        Symptoms may vary based on the specific type of heart condition.
                    </p>
                
                    <strong>Prevention:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Preventing heart disease involves healthy lifestyle habits such as eating a balanced diet low in saturated fats and salt, 
                        engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding smoking, managing stress, and maintaining a healthy weight. 
                        Regular health check-ups are also important for monitoring blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar.
                    </p>
                
                    <strong>Treatment:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Treatment may include medications to manage blood pressure and cholesterol (e.g., beta-blockers, statins), 
                        lifestyle changes, and medical procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery. 
                        Cardiac rehabilitation programs can also help patients recover and maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle.
