        <h3>Hand Washing</h3>
        <p>
            Washing your hands frequently is a crucial hygiene practice. 
            It's especially important to do so before and after eating, after using the toilet, after handling pets, after coughing or sneezing, and after being in public places. 
            The proper technique involves using soap and water to scrub your hands for a minimum of 20 seconds, ensuring you clean the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. 
            In situations where soap and water are not accessible, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can be used as an alternative. 
            This simple habit is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of germs, viruses, and other illnesses.

        <h3>Body Hygiene (Bathing/Showering)</h3>
        <p>
            Maintaining proper body hygiene is essential for overall health and well-being. 
            It is generally recommended to shower or bathe daily to effectively remove dirt, sweat, and bacteria from your skin. 
            During this process, you should use soap to wash your entire body, paying special attention to areas that tend to sweat more, such as the armpits and groin. 
            After washing, it's important to dry yourself completely to prevent the growth of bacteria that can lead to body odor. 
            For hair, the frequency of washing with shampoo depends on your individual hair type and needs, and should be done as needed to remove oil and buildup.

        <h3>Oral Hygiene</h3>
        <p>
            To maintain good oral hygiene, it's essential to brush your teeth at least twice a day—once in the morning and once before bed—using fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled brush. 
            You should brush for two minutes each time to ensure a thorough cleaning. Additionally, you should floss at least once a day to remove plaque and food particles from between your teeth, as these areas are often missed by brushing alone. 
            Following this routine is vital because good oral hygiene effectively prevents cavities, gum disease, and bad breath.

        <h3>Nail Care</h3>
        <p>
            For effective nail hygiene, it's important to keep your fingernails and toenails trimmed and clean. 
            To prevent ingrown nails, always trim them straight across. You should also regularly clean underneath your nails using a nail brush or a similar tool to remove any accumulated dirt and germs. 
            This practice is crucial because long or dirty nails can harbor a significant amount of bacteria and germs, which can then be easily transferred to your mouth and other parts of your body, potentially leading to illness.

          <h3>Respiratory Hygiene</h3>
          <p>
            Maintaining proper respiratory hygiene is crucial for preventing the spread of germs. 
            When you cough or sneeze, you should always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. 
            If you don't have a tissue, the best practice is to cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hands. 
            It's also important to dispose of used tissues immediately in a trash can. 
            These simple actions prevent germs from traveling through the air and from your hands to surfaces, protecting both yourself and others.

          <h3>Clothing Hygiene</h3>
          <p>
            Regularly washing your clothes is a fundamental part of good personal hygiene. 
            It's especially important to wash items like underwear, socks, and any clothes worn during exercise after each use. 
            This is because dirty clothes can harbor bacteria, sweat, and dead skin cells, which can lead to unpleasant body odor and potentially cause skin irritations or infections. 
            By maintaining a consistent laundry routine, you ensure your clothing is fresh and clean, contributing to your overall health and comfort.

          <p>
            Good food hygiene is essential for preventing illness. 
            You should always <b>wash your hands</b>thoroughly before you begin preparing or eating any food. 
            It's also critical to <b>properly store and handle food</b> to prevent contamination. Following these two simple steps significantly helps in preventing food-borne illnesses and the spread of germs.
